              information is requested by our system whenever confirmation
              of your permission is required to continue (e.g. asking for
              permission for the use of cookies when you visit our site,

              You will always have the choice whether to give us permission
              to process your information or not. With data that is not
              essential to the core functionality of our services (e.g.

            <span className={styles.privacy_text}>
              3.1. Data we collect <br />
              We collect various forms of personal identifiable
              information. This includes all information which could
              directly be used to identify you. This includes your name,
              e-mail address, payment information and more. We also collect
              data based on your usage of our platform with our optional
              cookies. This data is collected and processed fully
              anonymously, meaning it can not be traced back to you or your
              person.
              <br />
              3.2. How we use your data
              <br />
              We use your personally identifiable information for the
              following purposes: <br />
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Provide you with access to all of TheDream.AI’s features
                </li>
                <li>Process your payments</li>
                <li>
                  Inform you about important information regarding
                  TheDream.ai, as well as any other information you choose
                  to opt in to.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Contact you to inform you about the status of your order,
                  if there is a problem with your order, if you request us
                  to via our support services, or for other reasons you may
                  opt in to.
                </li>
              </ul>
              We use anonymous usage data to analyze the use of our
              platform by our users so we can improve our services. <br />
              Data regarding the use of our platform by our users may be
              shared with third parties we work with to improve our
              services and keep our activities running. This includes
              organizations like marketing agencies. This data will always
              be made fully anonymous before it’s shared.
              <br /> Some of your personal identifiable information may
              also need to be shared with our partners to provide you with
              our essential services. Examples include shipping companies
              when we need to physically mail you a product. In these
              cases, these partners will only be provided with the
              information absolutely necessary to provide their service.
              <br />
              If a legal request for your personally identifiable
              information or other information regarding you or your person
              is requested by a federal court, judge or law enforcement, we
              are legally required to provide them with your personal
              identifiable information. In these cases, we may do so
              without your permission and without informing you. Outside of
              these three categories, no party outside of TheDream.ai will
              ever get access to your personal information unless you
              specifically grant us permission. If we do wish to share your
              information with an external party outside of these three
              categories, we will always explicitly ask you for permission
              first.

              We retain your information as long as this is necessary to
              provide you with our services. All personal identifiable
              information will be deleted when you inform us you wish to
              stop using our services (e.g. by deleting your account), when
              your subscription expires, or when you explicitly request us
              to delete it. Once your request has been submitted and
              confirmed, your information will be deleted within 14 days.
              Information may be retained for longer if this is necessary
              for legal requirements. If required by law or ordered by a
              federal judge or court, we may retain information for longer
              and/or share it with said organization.
